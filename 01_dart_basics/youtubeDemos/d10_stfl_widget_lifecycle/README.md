### Explanation of the Lifecycle MethodsConstructor: 

1. **constructor** The `CounterWidgetState` constructor is called when the state object is instantiated. It’s not technically a lifecycle method but is included for completeness.
2. **initState**: Called once when the state object is inserted into the widget tree. Use it for one-time initialization, like setting up controllers or initial values.
3. **didChangeDependencies**: Called after `initState` and whenever the widget’s dependencies (e.g., inherited widgets) change. Useful for reacting to changes in inherited widgets.
4. **build**: Called whenever the widget needs to be rendered. This is where you define the UI. It’s called frequently, so keep it efficient.
5. **didUpdateWidget**: Called when the parent widget changes (e.g., its configuration changes) and the state needs to be updated. You can compare oldWidget with the current widget to handle updates.
6. **setState**: ~~Not a lifecycle method~~ but triggers a call to build when the state changes. In this demo, it’s called when the button is pressed to increment the counter.
7. **deactivate**: Called when the state is temporarily removed from the widget tree (e.g., when navigating to another screen but the widget might return).
8. **dispose**: Called when the state is permanently removed from the tree. Use it to clean up resources like controllers or subscriptions.
9. **reassemble**: Called during hot reload in debug mode. Useful for resetting state during development.

### Output: 

**when you run the app:**
```
constructor called
initstate called
didChangeDependencies called
build called
```

**when clicked on counter:**

```
setState called
build called
```

**during hot load:**

```
reassemble called
didUpdateWidget called
build called 
```
